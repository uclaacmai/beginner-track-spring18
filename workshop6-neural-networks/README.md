# Neural Network Playground
This is a notebook containing different neural network related excercises. It is meant to give you an intuition of how different parameters can affect the performance of a neural network.

**Note: This notebook will only work with Google Colaboratory**

## Using Google Colaboratory

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
3. Click on new notebook
4. Go to File -> upload notebook
5. upload Neural_Network_Playground.ipynb from where you saved the repository
6. Select Runtime -> change runtime type -> Python 3
